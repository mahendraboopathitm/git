# Visualization of Git:

Git visualization is a way to display commits, branches, and merges graphically so the repositoryâ€™s structure is easier to understand.
It helps developers see how changes flow through different branches without going through long commit histories.
Using visualization, you can quickly identify where new features were introduced and how the project has evolved.
It also shows how multiple team members have contributed to the code over time.
In short, Git visualization makes it simple to track progress, understand relationships between commits, and manage collaborative work efficiently.
